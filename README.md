# 🦙 LLaMA-Based Chatbot - GenAI Workshop Project

This project implements a simple chatbot using LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) architecture. It was developed as part of the **GenAI and Prompt Engineering Workshop** conducted by **ISTE MACE** at **MACE, Kothamangalam**.

The chatbot demonstrates how LLaMA-style language models can be used for basic conversational AI through prompt engineering techniques.
